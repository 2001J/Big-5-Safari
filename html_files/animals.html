        <h2>
          The Big Five: Africa's Most Iconic Wildlife
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you have gone on an African safari, chances are you have heard of the Big Five, the must-see list of
          iconic megafauna.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lions, leopards, elephants, African buffalo, and rhinoceroses are "what people think of when they
          think of Africa and wildlife," says Natalia Borrego, a research associate at the University of
          Minnesota Lion Centre.
        </p>

        <p>
          The term, coined in the late 1800s during Africa&apos;s colonial period, refers to what trophy hunters
          considered the most challenging and dangerous animals to hunt on foot.
        </p>

        <p>
          These animals are still hunted today, but a shift toward tourism has also made seeing the Big Five
          an "awe-inspiring" goal for any safari-goer.
        </p>

        <p>
          That&apos;s especially true because all of these species are decreasing in populationâ€”lions in
          particular are struggling, having lost 94 percent of their original habitat. Only about 20,000 of the
          big cats remain in the wild.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Big 5 - lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros, and Cape buffalo - hold a special significance in
          African ecosystems beyond their fame in safaris. Here's why they&apos;re crucial:
        </p>

        <p>&bull; <b>Keystone Species:</b> Each member of the Big 5 is considered a keystone species. This means
          their presence has a major impact on the overall health of the ecosystem. Their absence
          would cause significant disruptions.
        </p>

        <p>&bull; <b>Predators and Prey:</b> Lions and leopards are apex predators, controlling populations of
          herbivores and keeping prey species in check. This helps maintain a balance in the
          ecosystem and prevents any one species from overgrazing.
        </p>

        <p>&bull;<b>Seed Dispersal:</b> Elephants, large herbivores, are ecosystem engineers. They consume a vast
          amount of vegetation, and their dung scatters seeds throughout the savanna. This helps in
          plant propagation and maintains biodiversity.
        </p>

        <p> &bull; <b>Grazing and Browsing:</b> Buffalo and other large herbivores like elephants graze on grasses
          and browse on shrubs. This grazing and browsing patterns create a mosaic of grasslands and
          woodlands, promoting habitat diversity for a variety of animals.
        </p>

        <p>&bull; <b>Scavenging:</b> Big 5 carnivores like lions and hyenas also play a role as scavengers. They
          clean up carcasses, preventing the spread of diseases.
        </p>

        <p>
          In short, the Big 5 play vital roles in maintaining the delicate balance of African ecosystems. Their
          presence ensures healthy prey populations, seed dispersal, habitat diversity, and even disease
          control.

          <h3>
            Physical Characteristics of African Lion.
          </h3>

          <p>
            The most recognizable feature of male lions is their impressive
            mane, which ranges from blond to black. Females lack manes and are generally smaller.
            Both sexes have powerful bodies and sharp claws for hunting.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Habitat
          </h3>

          <p>
            Lions prefer savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands where they can easily stalk
            prey.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Behavior
          </h3>

          <p>
            Lions are social animals that live in prides, typically consisting of several related
            females, their young, and one or two males. They are apex predators, meaning they sit at the
            top of the food chain. Lions are skilled hunters known for their teamwork during hunts.

          <h3>
            Physical Characteristics of Leopard.
          </h3>

          <p>
            Leopards are known for their beautiful spotted coats, which
            provide excellent camouflage in their natural habitat. They are smaller and more slender
            than lions but are still powerful predators. Leopards are exceptional climbers with sharp
            retractable claws.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Habitat
          </h3>

          <p>
            Leopards are adaptable and can be found in various habitats, including savannas,
            forests, mountains, and even semi-deserts.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Behavior
          </h3>

          <p>
            Unlike lions, leopards are solitary creatures, coming together only to mate. They
            are excellent climbers and ambush predators, relying on stealth and agility to hunt their prey.

            Physical Characteristics of African Elephant.
          </h3>

          <p>
            The African elephant is the largest land animal on Earth. They
            have thick, wrinkled skin, large floppy ears, and prominent tusks. Their trunks are incredibly
            versatile, used for breathing, feeding, communication, and manipulating objects.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Habitat
          </h3>

          <p>
            African elephants live in savannas, grasslands, woodlands, and even some desert
            regions.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Behavior
          </h3>

          <p>
            Elephants are highly intelligent and social creatures. They live in herds led by
            experienced females, with strong social bonds between members. Elephants communicate
            through vocalizations, touch, and body language.

            Physical Characteristics of Black Rhino.
          </h3>

          <p>
            Sadly, the black rhinoceros is critically endangered due to
            poaching for their horns. They are large herbivores with thick, protective skin and one or
            two horns on their snouts. Despite the name "black rhinoceros," their color can range from
            grey to brown.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Habitat
          </h3>

          <p>
            Black rhinos prefer savannas, grasslands, and woodlands with access to water and
            browsing vegetation.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Behavior
          </h3>

          <p>
            Black rhinoceroses are generally solitary animals, except for mothers with
            calves. They have poor eyesight but excellent senses of smell and hearing. They are
            primarily grazers, using their strong prehensile lips to consume grasses and shrubs.

          <p>
            Cape buffaloes are large, stocky herbivores with impressive
            curved horns. They have a thick coat of black or dark brown fur. Despite their size, they can
            be surprisingly agile.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Habitat
          </h3>

          <p>
            Cape buffaloes are found in savannas, grasslands, woodlands with access to
            water and grazing areas.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Behavior
          </h3>

          <p>
            Cape buffaloes are highly social animals that live in large herds for protection.
            They are known for their aggressive temperament and will defend themselves fiercely
            against predators. Buffaloes graze on grasses and other vegetation throughout the day.
